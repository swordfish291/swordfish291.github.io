## Introduction
The AWS Lambda PowerShell runtime facilitates easier execution of Lambda functions written in PowerShell for event processing. It provides a more streamlined development process compared to the previous [.NET Core runtime](https://medium.com/@swordfish291/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-powershell-runtime-e970d7fe6d9b), eliminating the need for compilation steps and allowing for a native PowerShell experience. The runtime enables a variety of deployment tools and provides example applications for better understanding. It enhances code visibility, output control, and supports different handler options, thereby enriching the development, deployment, and management of PowerShell-based Lambda functions.

## How It Works
The AWS Lambda PowerShell runtime operates by utilizing Lambda's custom runtime functionality based on the provided.al2 runtime. It allows you to build, deploy, and invoke PowerShell Lambda functions using various tools like AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, AWS SAM, Serverless Framework, and AWS CDK.
